You can change a lot in regard to how RecipeJar looks with style sheets.
The Index is just a simple HTML page, and so is the view of recipes.
Unfortunately, due to limitations in Java, RecipeJar can only handle CSS 1.0.

However, there are some features to be aware of:
RecipeJar ignores style information given in the style element of the index and
recipe pages.  Instead, it uses the stylesheets given in the preferences dialog.

By default these are:
  * Index File: Recipes/style/index.css and
  * Recipe Files: Recipes/style/default.css

If you want to have the appearance of recipes, and or the index to be different
when viewed with a browser, simple edit the style element in it's respective [TemplateFiles template].

This may be useful, if for instance you use RecipeJar to maintain a [Publishing website], especially
since within the program one is limited to CSS 1.0.  That is, RecipeJar can be given
a CSS 1.0 style sheet, while persons using a browser may still see the recipes
in their full glory.
