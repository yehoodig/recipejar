===What works===
Everything. Sort of...

Because of the limitations of Java, RecipeJar cannot display markup that does not
conform to HTML 3.2.  You can still use newer markup, it just won't work unless you
view it in a browser.

RecipeJar will respond to links to other recipes, it will even accept informal links like:
{{{<a href="plum pudding">plum pudding</a>}}}.  The next time you edit the recipe this will see
that it is changed to the actual file name: {{{<a href="plumpudding.html">plum pudding</a>}}}.

In addition links to other websites will bring up a browser, and links to files will open them in their default program.

===What Doesn't===
Unclosed tags are very likely to cause a crash.

What this means: Always use {{{<hr/>}}} NOT {{{<hr>}}}, {{{<br/>}}} NOT {{{<br>}}} and don't leave meta tags unclosed.

So, feel free to use any kind of mark up you care too, within these limits.
