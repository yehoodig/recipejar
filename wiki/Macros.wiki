Macros are stored by default in the settings/macros.txt file.  This can be changed in
the Preferences dialog.  You can either change this file in a text editor, or in the Preferences dialog.

=To write a macro=
Simply type, on a new line:

{{{[Macro Name], [Mnemonic character], [Shortcut key], [Shortcut Mask], [Macro Text]}}}

==Macro Name==
Is *required* and is the name this macro will have in the Edit->Format menu.

==A Mnemonic==
Is also *required* and is best described as the most significant character in the Macro Name.  It is used to activate the macro when navigating the menus with the keyboard.

==Shortcut Key==
Is *not required*.  It is the character used, in association with the Shortcut Mask to activate the macro with the keyboard.  For instance, if the shortcut is CTRL-A, 'A' is the shortcut key and 'CTRL' is the shortcut Mask.

==Shortcut Mask==
Is *not required*.  It is the button or buttons used to let the program know you are about to activate a shortcut key.

|| *Acceptable values for Shortcut Mask* ||
||DEFAULT (Same as COMMAND/CMD in OSX or CTRL on all other systems)||
||CTRL||
||ALT||
||OPTION (Only works for OSX)||
||SHIFT||
||COMMAND (Only works for OSX)||
||CMD (Only works for OSX)||

==Macro Text==
Is *required*.  Macro Text is inserted at the current selection exactly as typed.  Everything from the comma to the end of the line.

You may insert special commands into the Macro Text:
|| *Command* || *What it does* ||
||{{{[SELECTION]}}}||Inserts the currently selected text||
||{{{[COLOR]}}}||Inserts a color selected by the user||
||{{{[COLOR:Name of Window]}}}||Same as above, but gives the popup window a different title||
||{{{[INPUT]}}}||Pops up an input window and inserts the user input||
||{{{[INPUT:Name of Window]}}}||Same as above, but with given title||



If a required field does not contain valid data, no macro will be produced.  If no shortcut mask is provided, the system default will be used.  If no shortcut key is provided, shortcut mask is ignored, and no shortcut key is assigned.

You may also include comments by typing a ";" at the beginning of a line.  Everything on that line will be ignored.

Examples:
   {{{Bold, B, B, CTRL,<strong>[SELECTION]</strong>}}}
      This macro surrounds the selection with the HTML code for bold text.

   {{{Text Color, T, C, ALT-SHIFT,<span style="color: #[COLOR:Pick a New Text Color];">[SELECTION]</span>}}}
      This macro inserts the HTML code to change the text color.
