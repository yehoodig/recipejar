Design Philosophies:
   Separate UI from Operations
   UI components should be simply presentational with little or no data processing
   UI component constructors should have no use of program information, like preferences.
   
   Internally UI components should have a protected method get[DataSource] which allows controlled access to the information source that the component depends on.
   Externally there should be a public method set[DataSource] to provide controlled creation to setting of the data source.  
   Component constructors should not have specialized arguments
   
Use files to script various functions and initialization where possible.

Menus can be defined by a file similar to the macros file:
===========
Recipe, R                                                  ;create a new menu
Recipe\Import From, I                                      ;create a submenu
Recipe\Import From\File..., F, F, ALT-SHIFT, FUNCTION_NAME ;create a menu item
