Units are stored by default in the settings/units.txt file.  This can be changed in
the Preferences dialog.  You can either change this file in a text editor, or in the Preferences dialog.

The format for a unit is as follows:
{{{[PLURAL],[SINGULAR],[CONVERTABLE UNIT1(CONVERSIONFACTOR1)|CONVERTABLE UNIT2(CONVERSIONFACTOR2)|...[CONVERTABLE UNITn(CONVERSIONFACTORn)]}}}

Where {{{[PLURAL]}}} is the plural name of the unit, {{{[SINGULAR]}}} is the singular name of the unit,
and CONVERTABLE UNITs are other units that this unit can be converted too, and CONVERSIONFACTOR defines the conversion function.

The only field that is required, is {{{[PLURAL]}}}.

Two kinds of functions are accepted as the CONVERSIONFACTOR: First, functions of the form "y=mx".
Examples:
Cups,Cup,Pints(1/2)
y=Pints
m=1/2
x=Cups

kgs,kg,grams(1000)
y=grams
m=1000
x=kgs

Second, functions of the form "y=mx+b)
Examples:
F=(9/5)*C+32
Celsius,Celsius,Farenheit(9/5+32)
y=Farenheit
m=9/5
b=32
x=Celsius


This second form allows for conversions whose units are not only
different in magnitude, but also on an offset scale.
