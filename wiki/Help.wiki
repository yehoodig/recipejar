Hi.

Since you are here, I assume you must have some questions about the RecipeJar program.
If you need help getting started, you might try the [Overview] page.
If on the other hand, are already familiar with the program, but need more specific
information you might be interested in one of the other topics listed below.

If you can't find what you need, give me an email: yehoodig {at} gmail {dot} com

Thanks,
   James McConnel

PS: I don't have an FAQ, because nobody has asked any questions.  If you want to be the first, email it to me.
