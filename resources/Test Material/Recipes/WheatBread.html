         <li><span class="qty">Plenty of</span> <span class="unit"></span> <span class="name">white flour</span></li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div id="procedure"><p>Dissolve the yeast in 3/4 cup warm water.  <br/>
Stir in 2 2/3 cups more warm water and everything except the flour.  <br/>
Then add the whole wheat flour and 2 cups of white flour.  <br/>
Keep adding more flour until it is "easy to handle".</p><br/>
<p>Put the dough on a clean surface that has been powdered with flour.  <br/>
Knead until "smooth and elastic", it should be retaining it's shape.  <br/>
<b>The less you mix and knead, the moister the bread will be.</b><br/>
Put into a greased bowl, and make sure it gets lightly coated with the grease.<br/>
This can be done by putting it in the bowl and then turning it over, or by <i>lightly</i>brushing oil onto the<br/>
 dough with a pastry brush.  <br/>
Let rise about an hour.</p><br/>
<p>Jab the dough with two fingers, if the divot stays, punch down the dough, <br/>
mixing in the smaller bubbles and popping the bigger ones.  <br/>
Cut in half, a butter knife works surprisingly well.  <br/>
Shape each half into loaves and place each into greased bread pans, grease the loaves.  <br/>
Let rise another hour, (err on the sooner side.)<br/>
The loaf should end up peaking about 1-2 inches above the pan.</p><br/>
<p>Place in oven with the top of loaf in the middle of the oven. <br/>
Bake at 375 for 30-35 minutes, until deep golden brown and hollow sounding when thumped.</p>        </div>
