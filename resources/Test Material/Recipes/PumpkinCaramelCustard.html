      <hr/>
          You will need:<br/>
          <div id="ingredients"><ul>
   <li>1 1/2 cups sugar</li>
   <li>2 cups lowfat milk</li>
   <li>1/2 cup pureed, cooked pumpkin</li>
   <li>4 eggs, lightly beaten</li>
   <li>2 Tbsp vanilla extract</li>
   <li>1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon</li>
   <li>1/2 tsp ground nutmeg</li>
   <li>1/4 tsp ground gingerroot</li>
</ul></div>
          <div id="procedure"><p>In a heavy saucepan, combine 1 cup of the sugar 
and 1/2 cup water.  Cook over medium heat.  Once
sugar has dissolved, swirl the pan and cook until it is
a deep caramel color.  Quickly divide the caramel among
6 dessert cups. Cool.</p>
<p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees.  Combine milk, pumpkin,
remaining sugar, and spices.  Pour into dessert cups.
Place in a baking pan; cover each with a piece of foil. 
Pour hot water into the pan so water is halfway up the 
cups.  Bake for 45 to 50 minutes.  Remove from the
baking pan and let cool.  Chill 4 to 24 hours.  Run
a knife around the sides; invert onto plates.</p>
